            AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[89] Reasoning can be
            reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads
            from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.[90] Planning
            algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process
            called means-ends analysis.[91] Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches
            in configuration space.
